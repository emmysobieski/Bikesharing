# Bikesharing Analysis Challenge

### Tableau Visualization:
Here is the link to the [Tableau Story](https://public.tableau.com/profile/em.smith#!/vizhome/Iowa_Bike_Rental_Business_Pitch/IowaBikePitch?publish=yes)

### Primary Question: What is the density of McDonald's in New York City ("NYC") versus Des Moines? Does this affect where people go in the city? If so, how?

I looked at the density of McDonalds in NYC and Des Moines, Iowa. McDonalds likely places their restaurants where people are gathering multiple times per day, ie in business districts. That way, they can serve 3 meals per day.  It is unlikely that the location of a McDonalds restaurant alters where people go in the city.  The causation is the other way around: McDonalds places restaurants where they see the highest traffic.  This can still be very useful data for examining a potential Bike Rental business.

When compared with NYC, the number of McDonalds is only 19% less whereas their population is 95% smaller.  Thus, McDonalds locations are more spread out in Des Moines, Iowa vs NYC.  I provided a side by side map both at the same 10 mile scale so you can visually see the difference in density of McDonalds.

##### Even though McDonalds location density is lower in Des Moines, there are other factors that make Des Moines worth considering for a Bike Rental Business.  As I built out Tableau Stories, I included these supporting data that show that NYC Ridesharing data is still a good predictor of the success of a Ridesharing business in Des Moines, Iowa:

Findings:

Even though the overall density is lower in Des Moines, Iowa, the density of McDonalds locations in NYC mirrors the density of ride destinations, which are both focused south of Central Park.

NYC Bike Rental times follow normal commuting hours, despite high tourist numbers that visit NYC.  This means that even though NYC has far more tourists, we can use the bike data to compare both cities, as 81% of the rides are subscribers, which are likely locals.  Thus NYC Data can be compared with Des Moines data to forecast bike usage for commuting.  NYC ride data is fairly consistent across time of day and age groups, reflecting a good business opportunity.

Comparing both cities using Census Data: 
Percent of Population ages 18-65:
NYC: 65% Des Moines: 64%

Percent of Population under 18:
NYC: 20.9%  Des Moines: 24.5%
Younger clients could shift the mix of overall clients to a younger demographic in Des Moines, vs NYC.  In NYC those under 25 had the longest rides, driving up revenue per ride in Des Moines vs NYC.

### Looking at why Des Moines has so many McDonald's per capita vs NYC and how that might relate to the merits of starting a Bike Rental business:

NYC has higher household income than Des Moines:
Household Income $60,762 vs $52,251
Median Gross Rent (2014-2018): $871 vs 498
Poverty: 18.9%  vs 17.2%
Sales per Capita: $11,067 vs $10,596
Des Moines has 42% lower rent, with only 14% lower household income, freeing them up to spend just 4% less per capita than people in NYC.  This is an attractive market with lower poverty and solid disposable income.

### Areas for further study

Looking at the NYC data, for those over 25, rides were consistently under 16 minutes.  Using McDonalds locations as a proxy for how spread out Des Moines is, from the two farthest locations, Walkee to Pleasant Hill, a bike ride on Google Maps is forecast to take 2 hours.  Most McDonalds in Des Moines are within 20 minutes of each other.  

The question for further study is at what point do people opt to commute by car, either ride share, cab, or drive?  

Also, Des Moines, with less population density, is likely to have less traffic and potentially a more pleasant bike riding experience.  Would this mean that riders would be willing to ride for longer?  

Finally, bike rentals is part of a larger transformation of the last miles of transportation, where people forgo their personal automobiles and take an Uber or Lyft for longer distances, a bike for medium distances, and a scooter for short distances.  This has first been a phenomenon in large metropolitan cities, as the cost and hassle of owning a car are the highest, and there are many ride sharing options. Part of future investigation should look at whether Uber and scooters are already successful in Des Moines, and thus the general trend is underway.

## Tableau Stories Overview:

Slide 1: Compares NYC Bike Rental Ride Density with NYC McDonalds location density to find that both are more dense south of Central Park.

Slide 2: Compares NYC McDonalds density with Des Moines McDonalds density.  Despite Des Moines having 97% fewer people than NYC, Des Moines only has 19% fewer McDonalds than NYC. Des Moines spends $10,596 per capita, comparable to NYC at $11,067.  This shows business can thrive in Des Moines.

Slide 3: Looks at the percentage of subscribers in NYC, at 81% and forecasts that this means with fewer tourists, the subscription business is a good forecasting tool as subscribers are likely locals and commuters.

Slide 4: Looks at the rides by time of day in NYC.  I removed the late hours to give more clarity to the hours from 7am to 10pm.  You can see in the graph a clear pattern of higher usage during commuting times (8am and again around 6pm), which supports the hypothesis that bike rentals are being used to commute.

Slide 5: Looks at the age of the rider compared with the length of trip.  Most riders over 25 had trips shorter than 16 minutes.  This data also shows that younger riders take longer rides.  Considering that Des Moines has a larger percentage of their population under age 18 vs New York, this could lead to longer rides and better revenue growth as this group becomes of riding age.

Slide 6: Trip duration, an issue for further study. Although this is an investor pitch, investors want to know that you are thinking about the downsides as well.  Presenting a balanced view builds trust.  Here, I showed the concentration of trip duration in miles, and most in NYC are under one mile.  This may be due to how small NYC is, and how bad the traffic is, but it bears exploring further before assuming NYC data is transferrable to Des Moines.

Slide 7: I present my conclusion that Bike Rental in Des Moines looks like an attractive business.  

### Conclusion: We should start at bike rental business in Des Moines, Iowa

Higher percentage of people in Des Moines are under 18, and will soon rent
Those under 25 years old rent for longer distances
Driving up Average Rental Distance

Those who commute, subscribe
A higher (70% vs 63%) percentage of Des Moines' Population
is in the Labor Force, and therefore commutes

Des Moines has lower poverty, similar per capita spending than NYC

Given the demographic similarities bewteen NYC and Des Moines, Iowa

We can forecast a business that:
Is used for commuting
